## Brokerage System for Logistics Companies (Microservices with Java and NodeJS)

This document outlines a microservices architecture for a brokerage system catering to logistics companies. The system tracks trucks and helps them find loads for efficient operations.

## Why Microservice Architecture is Suitable for a Logistics Brokerage System

A microservices architecture is well-suited for this system due to several reasons:

* **Complexity Management:** The system comprises distinct functionalities like truck management, load management, and matching. Each service can be developed and maintained independently, fostering better organization and modularity.

* **Scalability:** Different components might have varying resource demands. For instance, the Load Management service might handle a high influx of data during peak hours, while the Truck Management service might experience steady traffic. Microservices allow independent scaling based on specific needs, optimizing resource utilization.

* **Enhanced Development Speed and Agility:** Independent development, testing, and deployment of services lead to faster development cycles. This agility allows quicker adaptation to changing market demands or implementation of new features.

* **Fault Isolation:** If one service encounters an issue, it doesn't cripple the entire system. For example, a problem in the Load Matching service wouldn't affect Truck Management, ensuring system reliability and uptime.


## Real-World Examples of Microservices Usage

* **Maersk:**
    - A leading logistics company, Maersk utilizes microservices for their logistics platform. This platform involves services for shipment tracking, container management, customs clearance, and cargo documentation. Each service operates independently, enabling Maersk to offer real-time visibility and improve supply chain efficiency.

* **Flexport:**
    - Flexport, a freight forwarding and logistics company, leverages a microservices architecture. Their platform encompasses services for booking shipments, managing documentation, tracking shipments, and interacting with customs authorities. This modular approach allows Flexport to rapidly adapt to new trade regulations and provide seamless freight forwarding services.


## Service Boundaries:

Here's a high-level breakdown of the proposed microservices:

1. **Truck Management Microservice (Java):**
    - Manages truck registration, location tracking, driver details, and load capacity.
    - Interfaces with GPS devices for real-time location updates.

2. **Load Management Microservice (Java):**
    - Handles load creation, location details, cargo type, weight, and delivery requirements.
    - Provides functionalities for companies to post loads and specify preferences.

## Technology Stack and Communication Patterns:

**Java Microservices:**
* Programming Language: Java
* Framework: Spring Boot
* Database: PostgreSQL
* Communication: REST APIs

**NodeJS Microservice:**
* Programming Language: JavaScript (NodeJS)
* Framework: Express.js
* Database: MongoDB (optional)
* Communication: REST APIs and WebSockets

**Additional Considerations:**
* **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data (e.g., JWT authentication, authorization)
* **Containerization:** Docker for packaging and deployment
* **Monitoring:** Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and logging

## Design Data Management:

**Truck Entity (Java Microservice):**

```java
public class Truck {
  private Long id;
  private String licensePlate;
  private String driverName;
  private Location currentLocation;
  private double cargoCapacity;
  // ... other attributes
}
```

**Load Entity (Java Microservice):**

```java
public class Load {
  private Long id;
  private String origin;
  private String destination;
  private String cargoType;
  private double weight;
  private String deliveryRequirements;
  // ... other attributes
}
```

## API Endpoints (Examples)

**Truck Management Microservice (REST APIs):**

* `POST /api/trucks`: Register a new truck.
* `GET /api/trucks/{id}`: Get details of a specific truck.
* `PUT /api/trucks/{id}`: Update truck information.
* (Real-time location updates via separate mechanism)

**Load Management Microservice (REST APIs):**

* `POST /api/loads`: Create a new load.
* `GET /api/loads/{id}`: Get details of a specific load.
* `PUT /api/loads/{id}`: Update load information.

**Load Matching Microservice (REST APIs and WebSockets):**

* `POST /api/matching/request`:
